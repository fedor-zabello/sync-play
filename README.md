# Getting Started

### This project uses Spring Modulith

This project follows a modular monolith architecture using Spring Modulith
to logically organize the codebase into feature-specific modules. 
Each module is designed to be independent and encapsulates related functionality.

This project contains application modules tests, which test that internal classes
of one package are not imported in other packages.
